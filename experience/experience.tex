                \item Led the effort to evaluate various available open source alternatives eg: CouchDB, RocksDB, Redis, FDB etc to replace the custom storage engine
                \item Led a team of 5 engineers in developing an in-house layer on top of the key-value store to support SQL-like queries and contributed patches back to Foundation-DB for the existing layers.
                \item Designed and developed a simulation framework for load testing SecDB and simulate various failure scenarios in an easily reproducible and extensible manner.

        \item \textbf{Remote File System for Bazel}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item {Authored multiple design proposals aimed at improving build infra for a monorepo at GS.}
                \item {Added a Remote file system module for Bazel, an Open source build system developed at Google. This is currently in review for acceptance into the open source repository}
                \item Improved Build performance for a monorepo of size ~4.5 Gbs by a magnitude of 60\% reduction in CI build times
                \item Developed additional tooling around Bazel to be used internally for providing a fine-grained view of a build both as a web service and integration into IDE. 
                \item Led multiple training sessions to familiarize current developers with the new build system and insight into how builds can be optimized
            \end{itemize}
            
        \item \textbf{Data Quality Framework}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item {Co-authored a research paper detailing how Association Rule mining can be used to analyze Data quality issues in a very large dataset}
                \item {The framework improved the efficiency of a mission critical system which sends out reports to UK and US financial regulators, where the punitive damages of missing deadlines is both financial and reputational.
                \item Eliminated human intervention in sanity checking of data by automating discovery of rules on historical data  and generating alerts and action items when tolerance is breached.}
